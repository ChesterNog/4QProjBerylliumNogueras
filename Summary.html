	<h1> Basic Information on Possible Symptoms </h1>
	
	<h3> Cough </h3>
	<p>Your airways, stomach or esophagus are irritated or blocked, causing the body to force it out by forcing muscles and air. Make sure to drink water and identify if there are foreign objects within the three.</p>
	<h3> Fever</h3>
	<p>Your immune system is responding to something within your body. Drink some water and rest well, fevers generally last a few days.</p>
	<h3> Shortness of Breath</h3>
	<p> Your airways are either inflamed or blocked, medication is advised.</p>
	<h3> Fatigue </h3>
